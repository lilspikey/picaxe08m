This is a catch all repo for code used on a picaxe 08m chip.

The 08m is a tiny chip, only has 256 *bytes* of memory.  It's programmed using Basic and only requires a couple of additional resistors for the basic circuit.  Although it's simple it can drive servos, get input from infrared and temperature sensors and much more.
